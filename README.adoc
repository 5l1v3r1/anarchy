Anarchy Operator
================

The Anarchy operator provides a method of managing state for otherwise stateless API operations.
The name "anarchy" is both ironic and to the point.
While the anarchy operator governs interactions with RESTful APIs, it leaves the nature of the requests open for configuration.

Anarchy is configured through the definition of governors.
Anarchy governors define the strategy for controlling an anarchy subject by defining actions to execute on the subject.
Actions are tracked as custom resources, allowing for complete visibility of current state of the subject.
